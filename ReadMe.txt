** Linear Regression Model **

This model is to measure the impact of various factors like Gender, Kids, Income, Readers etc on TV Channel Subscription for a TV company. I did this analysis alone. I built a linear regression model to get the contribuiton of each of the factors. I did an analysis on which factors are most significant which are directly affecting the memberships on various channels. Which factors are leading to an increase/decrease in the number of subscriptions. I have attached a word file to explain the interpretations in more detail.


Documents attached in this folder:

1. Input SAS dataset (Movie_Sport_SAS)
2. SAS code to run the model
3. Output word file


How to run the code?

Step 1. Please download the Movie_Sport_SAS SAS dataset in your local system.
Step 2. Note the file path where you have saved the file.
Step 3. Set the 'libname' as the name of your drive/folder where the files are saved(libname DMEF "H:\Mkt_SAS\").
Step 4. Yes, now you are ready to run the code.
Step 5. After the code is run successfuly there be an output file generated in SAS Framework itself.
